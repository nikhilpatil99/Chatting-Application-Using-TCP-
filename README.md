# Chatting-Application-Using-TCP

The GUI consisted of 3 tabs for this project and it is entirely based on Java and consists of three parts: 1st client, 2nd client and Server. This chat application can be used by two people for chatting. Both can send and  receive messages through Server. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) was used to develop the chat application. The messages are encrypted and decrypted at only client side and server can view the data traffic between two clients but server cannot decrypt messages.
